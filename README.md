🧠 Next Word Prediction using Deep Learning (NLP)

This project implements a Next-Word Prediction Model using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model learns language patterns from text data and predicts the most likely next word in a sentence — similar to how keyboards and AI writing tools auto-complete text.

✨ Features

✔ Text preprocessing (tokenization, sequences, padding)

✔ Deep learning model built using LSTM/GRU layers

✔ Trains on user-provided text data

✔ Predicts the next word based on input phrase

✔ Jupyter Notebook workflow for easy understanding

✔ Visualizations for accuracy & training performance

🧠 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

NLP preprocessing tools

📌 How It Works

Dataset is cleaned and tokenized

Input sequences are generated for next-word prediction

Model is trained using LSTM-based architecture

User enters a starting sentence

Model predicts the next possible word
